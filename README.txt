The WIC NSS Self-Assessment module was created for the WICWorks office at NAL.
This module extends the Book and Webform modules to create a self-assessment
application for self-improvement of WIC clinics and agencies.  It provides
progress tracking via a dashboard page, HTML and PDF report generation, a custom
webform component for setting improvement goals, and email reminders about those
goals.

The dependency on the Node Clone module is optional.  It does not have to be
enabled for the Self-Assessment module to work correctly.  Node Clone is an
excellent tool for templating and generating new forms quickly, which is
required by the NSS project.
